<h2>Smart Hand Analysis and Decision Enhancing System</h2>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>This is my repo for the code I wrote for my <strong>AI Poker Glasses</strong> YouTube video.</p>

<h3>Important Notice</h3>
<p>GitHub has a file limit so you can fine my trained model here</p>

<p>Code should work after you install all the dependencies. Since it uses your screen as a regerence any usb camera should work. No need to buy the actual glasses.</p>
